#Problem Statement

With rapid urbanization and increased population density in cities, there is a heightened need for mobility solutions. Private vehicles are a preferred mode of transportation for many people in developed economies. As the standard of living continues to go up in several parts of the world, more and more people and companies buy new cars. Malls and other commercial centers are also increasing in cities, attracting more and more people who prefer to drive in with their cars. Parking a car in the allotted place in the parking area is always a cumbersome task in enormous malls and hospitals etc. This has increased the need for an efficient parking lot management system in malls to ensure people have a hassle-free experience. An efficient algorithm is required to make sure that a person is able to park his/her car in the allotted parking space.
